# Building Blazor Web Application !

Hi! This responistory  is my first attempt to building a blazor Web application using Visual Studio and Microsoft Azure.  The responsitory consisted of a templete that I used from Aaron who provided the first steps to creating a web application. As well as, having the opportunity to modify and enchance it.  


## Files and folders

There are **four folder** that are good to know and they are: 

- **Api**: The Blazor application will call the Azure Function. 
- **Clinet**: Contain the Blazor WebAsembly application such as the class pages, and the main pages where it all connect.
- **Shared**: A class library
- **.vscode**: The visual studio code workspace.

## About the project
The project is created on the concept that I learn in class as well as the ones that I learn from the tutorials.  The idea is to create a website that take input from the user and provide output. It is designed to be user-friendly and easy to read. 

## Tutorials
The **first tutorial** is on how to create your **first Blazor app with Azure**.

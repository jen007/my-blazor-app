Hi! This responistory  is my first attempt to building a blazor Web application using Visual Studio and Microsoft Azure.  The responsitory consisted of a templete that I used from Aaron who provide the first steps to creating a web application and as well have the oppunity to modify and enchance it.  


## Files and folders

There are **four folder** that are good to know and they are: 

- **Api**: The Blazor application will call the Azure Function. 
- **Clinet**: Contain the Blazor WebAsembly application such as the class pages, and the main pages where it all connect.
- **Shared**: A class library
- **.vscode**: The vistual studio code workspace.

## About the project
The project is created on the concept that I learn in class as well as the ones that I learn from the tutorials.  The idea is to create a website take can take input from user and provide output.  It design to be user friendly and easy to read.
